# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe Game – React Essentials Deep Dive

A beginner-friendly **React practice project** exploring essential React concepts such as `Components`, `JSX`, `State`, `Props`, and `Conditional Rendering`.

This is part of the [React Projects](https://github.com/al-badarin/React-Projects) series, where I experiment with fun and educational React-based builds.

## 🧠 What I learned and applied

- 🔸 **Dynamic Components**: Splitting logic between Player, GameBoard, Log, and GameOver
- 🔸 **React State Management**: Tracking turns, winners, and game resets
- 🔸 **Immutability**: Avoiding direct mutations of the game board
- 🔸 **Derived State**: Using helper functions to compute game logic like active player or winner
- 🔸 **Controlled Inputs**: Editable player names via input fields
- 🔸 **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying winner/draw messages dynamically
