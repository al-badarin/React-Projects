# 🚀 React Projects 2025 (incl. Redux & Next.js)

This repository is my personal workspace of my ongoing journey to sharpen and deepen my React skills. It contains all my practice projects, exercises, and demos
.

What I am obtaining in my React projects:

- Building blocks: **Components**, **JSX**, **Props**, **State**, and React **Hooks**
- Handling **events**, **lists**, **forms**, **validation**, and **side-effects**
- Advanced APIs: **Fragments**, **Portals**, **Context API**, **Redux / Redux Toolkit**
- **React Router** for client-side navigation and data loading
- **Next.js** with the new **App Router**, **Server Components**, and **Form Actions**
- **Animations** using libraries like Framer Motion
- Fetching data and asynchronous patterns with **React Query**
- **Unit testing** and debugging techniques
- **TypeScript** integration
- **Auth** and deployed full-stack apps, real-world best practices and patterns

## 🎓 What I've Learned in the Coding Process

- React core: components, JSX, props, state, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks`)
- Form handling, validation, controlled components
- HTTP communication (fetch, axios), error and loading states
- Redux Toolkit for global state logic
- Context API vs Redux decisions
- React Router (v6+): nested routing, loaders, actions
- Next.js: server components, form actions, SSR/SSG, API routes
- Authentication flows (e.g. tokens, protected routes)
- TypeScript integration into React codebase
- Animations with Framer Motion and UI polishing
- Code quality: linting, formatting, project structure
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library basics
- Deployment to production environments
