# 🚀 [React Essentials – Core Concepts] (https://react-essentials-albadarin.netlify.app/)

A simple and visual **React practice project** introducing the core building blocks of modern React development: `Components`, `JSX`, `Props`, and `State`.

This project is part of my [React Projects](https://github.com/al-badarin/React-Projects) folder where you can find more demos and games.  
It’s a beginner-friendly introduction with interactive examples and explanations.
